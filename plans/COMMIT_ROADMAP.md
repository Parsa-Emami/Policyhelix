# PolicyHelix — product implementation roadmap

Web application delivery is tracked separately in [WEB_ROADMAP.md](WEB_ROADMAP.md). Engine milestones remain pending unless backed by their own evidence.

## C01 — `docs(product): confirm personal use acceptance and demand hypotheses`

Stage: foundation. Dependencies: None. Requirements: N01.

Deliverables: `docs/product/VALIDATION_LOG.md`.

- Choose one owned real task, identify current workaround and record measured baseline; public demand remains unvalidated.

Verification: Run the actual project checks relevant to this task and record results in docs/evidence/C01.json.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/C01.json`.

Rollback: Before release: revert isolated code change with tests. For persisted data: preserve exports/backup and last compatible reader; use forward repair after new writes. Do not restore a stale snapshot over newer data.

## C02 — `chore(toolchain): verify supported versions and lock dependencies`

Stage: foundation. Dependencies: C01. Requirements: N02.

Deliverables: `docs/engineering/toolchain-lock.json`.

- Official support/release URLs and verification date exist for each selected dependency; no future or assumed version pin.

Verification: Run the actual project checks relevant to this task and record results in docs/evidence/C02.json.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/C02.json`.

Rollback: Before release: revert isolated code change with tests. For persisted data: preserve exports/backup and last compatible reader; use forward repair after new writes. Do not restore a stale snapshot over newer data.
